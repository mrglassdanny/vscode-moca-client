Provides MOCA client and language support for Visual Studio Code via the [MOCA Language Server].


## Demos

[Demos]


## Quick Start

[Quick Start Demo]

1. Install extension
[vscode Extension Marketplace]

2. Make sure [minimum Java version] is installed and either:
    - set [JRE_HOME] environment variable
    - set [JAVA_HOME] environment variable
    - set javapath in PATH environment variable

3. Extension is activated after you either:
    - open MOCA file (.moca **OR** .msql)
        - no difference between .moca and .msql -- just 2 extensions for the same thing
    - make MOCA connection
